classdef ADataHandle < matlab.mixin.Copyable
% ADatahandle abstract data handle for the individual data saving and 
% loading capabilities to inherent. This class will hold the capability to:
% - load the data given a file path
% - store the data in a structure that makes sense for the data on hand
% - provide a plotting capability to visualize the data 
%
% the contents of this class will be used in conjunction with
% exerciseDataset, which will contain an instance of this class, so
% demographic information such as subject number and exercise type should
% already be available there
%
% if the nature of the data is such that there are multiple instances of a
% given data, such as the IMU devices, use this class as an array
